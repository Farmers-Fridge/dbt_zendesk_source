          When support requests arrive in Zendesk Support, they can be assigned to a Group. Groups serve as the core
          element of ticket workflow; support agents are organized into Groups and tickets can be assigned to a Group
          only, or to an assigned agent within a Group. A ticket can never be assigned to an agent without also being
          assigned to a Group.

          by their email address domain. Organizations can be used in business rules to route tickets to groups of agents or
          to send email notifications.
